## ⚡ Motivation

- **Pleasure, enjoyment, and engagement** are reliable sources of motivation for maintaining momentum over time.
- **Fear** can spark action, but it’s not sustainable long-term.

## 🎯 Focus & Task Management

- The world rewards **productivity**, not **perfection**:
  - Don’t spend excessive time perfecting a task. Instead, **keep producing**—your skills will improve with repetition.
  - **Perfection is unattainable**. Delivering something “half-right” creates space for others to contribute and feel engaged.
  - Embrace **agile objectives** and stay flexible with the environment. Rather than defending a fixed goal, accept others opinion and look for opportunities to adapt/improve to move the project forward.
- Avoid **multitasking** and frequent **task switching**.
  - Choose **one task**, focus on it, **complete it**, then move to the next.

## ⏱️ Time & Energy Management

- Follow the **Pomodoro technique**:
  - Work in focused intervals.
  - Take regular breaks: breathe deeply, walk, talk.
  - Every **20 minutes**, look at something **20 feet (≈6 meters)** away for **20 seconds** to reduce eye strain.
  - Remember: **life is a marathon**, not a sprint.

## 🗓️ Planning & Prioritization

- You **can’t do everything**—focus on just **five key objectives** for the year.
- Spend **5 minutes daily** planning your to-do list:
  - Ensure tasks align with your five objectives.
- Hold a **weekly retrospective** to reflect and adjust.

## 🧪 Learning Through Failure

- Don’t rush to judge failure—it’s not fun, but it’s not final.
  - Reframe it as: **“not succeeding yet.”**
  - Every experiment increases knowledge.
  - Keep producing—your next iteration might be the breakthrough.
