## 🏛️ The Two Pillars of Lean

- **Kaizen**: Continuous incremental improvement.
- **Kaikaku**:When reorganization is needed, make radical change at once.

## 🧰 Conceptual Tools

### 📦 Pull System
- Produce only when there is a **demand**.
- The system is guided by **expected/required demand**.

### 🧭 5W2H
- **Who** does **What**, **Where**, **When**, **Why**, **How**, and **How much**.

### 🔄 5S Framework
- **Sort**: Eliminate unnecessary items.
- **Set in Order**: Organize items for easy access.
- **Shine**: Clean the workspace.
- **Standardize**: Establish consistent procedures.
- **Sustain**: Maintain and review standards regularly.

### 📊 PDCA Cycle
- **Plan**: Identify goals and processes.
- **Do**: Implement the plan.
- **Check**: Evaluate results.
- **Act**: Make adjustments and improve.

### ❓ 5 Whys
- Ask "Why?" repeatedly until the **root cause** of an issue is uncovered.

### 🧠 Cause & Effect (Ishikawa Diagram)
- Identify and categorize causes using the **5M** framework:
  - **Man**: Human-related factors
  - **Machine**: Technology issues
  - **Method**: Procedural problems
  - **Material**: Input-related issues
  - **Measurement**: Data or metrics problems

### 🗑️ 7 Sources of Waste (Muda)
1. **Transportation**: Unnecessary movement of materials or information.
2. **Inventory**: Items produced but not yet delivered.
3. **Motion**: Unproductive movement of people.
4. **Waiting**: Idle time due to upstream delays.
5. **Over-production**: Producing more or earlier than needed.
6. **Over-processing**: Processing more quality than required.
7. **Defects**: Errors, especially those reaching the customer.

## ⚙️ Process Tools

### 🗂️ Kanban
- Visual cards placed on a board with status:
  - **To Do**, **In Progress**, **Done**
- Helps track tasks and supports the pull system.

### 🚫 Poka-Yoke
- Error prevention through design by contract.
- Make errors **immediately obvious** so they can be corrected quickly.

### 👥 RACI Matrix
- **Responsible**: The doer(s)
- **Accountable**: The one (and only one) with authority
- **Consulted**: Involved before decisions/actions
