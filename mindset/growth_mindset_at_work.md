## Understanding the Growth Mindset
We all carry a blend of **fixed** and **growth** mindsets. Developing a growth mindset is not a one-time shift—it requires **ongoing awareness** and **intentional practice**.  
Growth mindset is the fact that you know that you can do better (without need to compare to others)
  * if you perform worse than others, you are experimenting to learn and do better, ask for feedback and improve
  * if you perform better than others, still you can do better, ask for feedback and improve
  * if you perform better than yesterday, you are growing

## Growth Mindset vs. Fixed Mindset

| Growth Mindset | Fixed Mindset |
|----------------|----------------|
| Embrace challenges ("I can do it") | Avoid challenges ("I can't do it") |
| Appreciate feedback | Feel defensive about criticism |
| See failure as a learning opportunity | See failure as a threat |
| Persist through difficulties and see effort as the path to mastery | Give up easily and see effort as fruitless |
| Inspired by others' success | Threatened by others' success |
| Thrive in change and uncertainty | Avoid growth opportunities |

## Key Beliefs to Foster

- **Skills are built** through time, effort, and practice—not innate talent.
- **Anxiety and self-doubt** are protective mechanisms, not truths. Recognize them as stories, not facts. When we balance our fears, we become:
  - More **joyful**, **calm**, and **confident**
  - Less likely to compare ourselves to others
  - Less prone to insecurity
- **Self-compassion** helps you embrace failure:
  - Be kind and understanding to yourself.
  - Recognize that imperfection is part of being human.
  - Practice mindfulness—acknowledge both wins and setbacks without overidentifying with either.

## How to Develop a Growth Mindset at Work

### 🔄 Embrace the Power of “Not Yet”
- Replace binary thinking (pass/fail) with progress-oriented thinking.
- “Not yet” signals that growth is possible and ongoing.
- Reduces the pressure of immediate success.

### 🎯 Set Learning Goals, Not Just Performance Goals
- **Performance goals** = outcomes (e.g., hitting KPIs)
- **Learning goals** = skill development and long-term growth
- Learning goals build resilience and deeper improvement.

### 🧠 Use Deliberate Practice
- Go beyond repetition—set challenging goals.
- Seek feedback and adjust your approach regularly.

### 💬 Ask for Improvement Feedback
- Much of praise can reinforce a fixed mindset.
- Ask: “How can I improve?” instead of “Was this good?”
- Encourages continuous learning and reflection.

### 🔍 Revisit and Reassess Long-Term Goals
- Connect daily work to a broader purpose.
- Reflect and adjust goals to align with evolving values and interests.

## 💡 Final Thought
Your mindset shapes how you respond to change. As your goals and perspectives evolve, so should your approach to work. A **growth mindset** empowers you to adapt, learn, and thrive in a constantly changing world.
